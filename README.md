# Purpose

To provide an example of how to use Vue3 + Vite with Shoelace

## Getting Started

Click the `Use This Template` button on Github.

Then, once cloned locally, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After installation, add the shoelace icons to your `public/assets/icons`
directory by running the provided script:

```bash
npm run shoelace:copy
```

Finally, start up the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to `localhost:3000` and you should see a gear icon on the home page
if everything went according to plan!
